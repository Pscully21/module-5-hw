# module-5-hw
This module 5 assignment was about getting used to using and linking API's within our code, The day planner that I have made is structured to color-code past, present, and future tasks in which are written on the planner by the person using it. It displays the date and time up at the top of the page, and is followed up by the planner ranging from 7 am to 9 pm. Overall this was a good interactive assignment made to help us better understand local storage and using different API's to make webpages more interactive and informative.
